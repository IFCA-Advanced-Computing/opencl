* OpenCL
  A high-level OpenCL library for Haskell.

  Based on the [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/OpenCLRaw][OpenCLRaw]] package by J.R. Heard.

** Installation
   *Requirements:* [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/c2hs][c2hs]] must be installed. (Try ~cabal install c2hs~.)

  With the usual commands to install as a user library:
  
  : cabal install --user

  Programs using the library must link against OpenCL; for example, by
  passing `-lOpenCL` to GHC.

** Optional Requisites
   Some OpenCL libraries require additional NUMA libraries. For instance,
   on Ubuntu 11.04:

   : sudo apt-get install libnuma1 libnuma-dev

** Example
   There is an simple working example in the examples folder. You can create an
   executable using:

   : ghc --make -lOpenCL examples/example01.hs

** Using ghci

   It's possible to use GHCi with OpenCL, e.g.:

   : ghci -lOpenCL examples/example01.hs
